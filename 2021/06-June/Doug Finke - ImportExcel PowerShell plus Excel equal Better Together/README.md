### Summary

One of the most common daily tasks for an IT pro is to produce reports of company data for executives. PowerShell gives us the tools to query the data we need, but turning that data into meaningful reports can sometimes present a challenge. If you work with PowerShell and your management likes Excel spreadsheets, then you need to know about the ImportExcel module by Doug Finke!

Do you desire great looking reports, dashboards, including charts, pivot tables, filterable lists? This PowerShell module will let you do that and more. You’ll glue together data from SQL, CSV files, data from REST APIs, JSON and more to provide quality reports, providing your users’ information in one of the most ubiquitous tools, Microsoft Excel.

Plus, you don’t need to have Excel installed to make it happen.

This enables you to make use of Continuous Integration (CI) daily for heavy time-consuming tasks to game up your productivity to the next level.
