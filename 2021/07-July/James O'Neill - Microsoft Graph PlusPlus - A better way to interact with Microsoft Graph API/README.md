### Summary

he Microsoft Graph API is the future of querying data from the Azure cloud. It's incredibly powerful but isn't very PowerShell friendly.

James O'Neill is a former Microsoft employee who built a module that adds support for using all the PowerShell goodness you come to love but is missing from the Graph API.

If you need to work with the Graph API, then this module is an absolute time saver and a must-have tool for your toolkit. Join us on Wed, 7/21 for demo of how this incredibly useful module works. This module contains over a 100 cmdlets missing from the Graph API.
