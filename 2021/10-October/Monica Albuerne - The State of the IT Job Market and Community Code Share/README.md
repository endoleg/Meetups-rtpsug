### Summary

Join us for a discussion on the state of the IT market post 2020/Covid and the what impact PowerShell has on a local and a national level.

Our guests this month are Monica Albuerne & Brandon Krzykowski from TEK Systems. Monica and Brandon will share data they have gathered about trends in IT labor market and how things have changed since the onset of COVID-19.

TEK Systems is a frequent guest of ours and they always bring some excellent insight into IT trends happening in the job landscape. They've put together a 20 minute discussion for our members to help everyone better understand what looking for job post covid looks like.

After our discussion with TEK Systems, we'll host a shortened version of our community code share. We'll invite attendees to share with us snippets of code, scripts, modules, website and IT articles that they found useful.
