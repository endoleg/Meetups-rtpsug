### Summary

Azure DevOps is a set of services offered by Microsoft to create and maintain automation in the Azure cloud. Most people look at Azure DevOps and see a service that is built for dev's to maintain and release code releases. But if you look closely, you'll see a set of tools for sysadmins to use for running automation (ie scheduled jobs) in the cloud or even on your own corporate on premises servers.

Our speaker for this presentation is Mike Kanakos, who is an Infrastructure Tools Engineer for InvisAlign and a Microsoft Cloud and Datacenter MVP. Mike specializes in managing directory services through automation. Join Mike for a look at how you can get started with Azure DevOps and replace your dodgy scheduled tasks in only a few hours' time.
