### Summary

Azure is the behemoth cloud offering from Microsoft. There are other cloud providers available but chances are that if you work in IT you have SOMETHING in the Azure Cloud by now. Whether or not you like it, Microsoft Azure is here to stay. If you 're an IT pro, you NEED to know Azure and how it fits into the IT World.

Getting certified in Azure is one of the best ways to learn the cloud and prove what you know. But the certification process and the material available for today’s certifications differs VASTLY from when you got your MCSE. Join our guest speaker, Michael Bender for a discussion of certification basics, how Microsoft (and other vendor certs) work, and how to get started down the road.

Michael is an author, teacher, and community leader. Having been in the IT industry since the 90s, his experiences covers the gamut of Microsoft technologies, with his primary focus being Windows Server, PowerShell and Microsoft Azure as an Author Evangelist as Pluralsight. Along with training, he has a passion for connecting people and building community in the IT Pro space. He is the current president and a founding member of The Krewe User Groups, Inc., a world-wide networking group for IT Pros and Developers.

Asa bonus, Michael will have some surprises that you will not want to miss! But they’re only available to attendees of our live session, so make sure you sign up and join us for a lively discussion with Michael!
