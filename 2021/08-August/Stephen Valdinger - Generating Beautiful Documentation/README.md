### Summary

Does this sound familiar? You love PowerShell because it's awesome and, with PowerShell, you can create automation to eliminate manual tasks. But... you don't love writing the documentation for your code....

Yeah we hear you, most people don't look forward to the documentation cause it can be slow and tedious. But what if you could AUTOMATE your documentation as well?

Our speaker for our next meeting is Stephen Valdinger aka Steviecoaster of Chocolatey fame! Stevie is one of those guys who just oozes code from his pores. He finds ways to automate almost everything he works on.

Join Steviecoaster for a look at how you can add beautiful docs to your projects with automation. Ask Stevie and he'll say "UX starts well before an end user executes a single line of your code. Providing a well-formatted, thoughtful, and inviting place for your documentation shows the end user a lot about your project, and even you as a developer."
