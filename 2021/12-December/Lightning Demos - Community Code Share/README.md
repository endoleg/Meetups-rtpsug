### Summary

Time for the community to roll their sleeves and show off their own code in small 5-10 minute demos. Let’s share the tools and scripts that we use in our daily work lives. Anyone can share: beginner to advanced!

Did you solve a problem at work that you think could help someone else?
Share your knowledge and pass along some tips and tricks to fellow community members.

Do you have a problem that you can’t seem to figure out?
Let the community help you get past a problem you are having difficulty with!

Show off anything you find interesting that saves you time or makes your job easier.

So what’s good to share?

Anything that you think may be useful to others is open for consideration. It could be a two-line script or a complex function. Community sharing is about exposing code to others so can benefit from your work. We cater to all skill levels, so it’s ok (and encouraged) to show off a simple script that you found helpful. We all benefit when we pull out our tools and show others how they work.

No slides, or fancy presentations, just share some code to show what it does. Each person only needs to fill about five minutes’ time.
