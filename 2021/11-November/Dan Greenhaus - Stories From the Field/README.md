### Summary

Let’s talk about how we can take automation beyond the infrastructure IT role and show how it can automate upgrading server-based applications. We’ll cover taking snapshots in vCenter, disabling server monitoring, stopping services on multiple servers, terminating file share access, resetting IIS, changing config files, and cleaning up; all from a single server.
