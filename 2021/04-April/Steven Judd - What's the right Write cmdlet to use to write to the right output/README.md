### Summary

Have you ever wondered if you're writing data in your scripts the correct way? For example, when should you use Write-Host vs Write-Output? How do you write to the console and the logs at the same time?

Join Steven Judd for walk through on the Write-* cmdlets. He will explain what the cmdlets are, how they work and what they should be used for. This talk is designed for both beginners and scripting pros, because this is a topic that so many people can improve on in their own personal usage.
