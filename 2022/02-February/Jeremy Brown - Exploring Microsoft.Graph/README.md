### Summary

Microsoft has stated the AzureAD and MSOL modules are being deprecated! We need to move to the Microsoft.Graph module if we want our scripts to keep working. Come join us to see how to get started with the Microsoft.Graph module. We're going to look at how to explore the Graph module, use it interactively, setup an app registration for automation, create some users and groups, and pull back some information about those objects.

Join Jeremy Brown for a look at the new Microsoft.Graph module and some of the features available!
