Bio:
Starting at the help desk in 2009, Anthony Howell has built a career in IT automation and development, with a focus on PowerShell. This includes a lot of boring things, like user lifecycle automation or custom application installation scripts, but it also includes some really cool and exciting things, such as API module development (including AutoRest) or cloud automation projects. It really is just too much to fit under one day job -- so you might also find him blogging and speaking on PowerShell, when he's not picking up some PowerShell consulting projects on the side.
