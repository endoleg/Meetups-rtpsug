### Summary

Looking for an easy way to build and deploy a self-service portal to run your PowerShell code?? Look no further than WebJEA! This open source tool built by Mark Domansky is web front-end for your PowerShell scripts. The tool builds a web portal that users can interact with to run PowerShell scripts, having no knowledge or rights to run PowerShell on their own.

Join Mike Kanakos for a walk-through of what is involved to get this portal installed and running. Then we'll import some PowerShell scripts and show what it looks like running this console!
