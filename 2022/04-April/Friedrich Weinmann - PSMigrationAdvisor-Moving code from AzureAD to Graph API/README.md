### Summary

The old AzureAD and MSOL modules and associated API's are being retired. The new way to do things is in the Graph API.

What about all those scripts you wrote that rely on those modules and the existing API's?

Fear not, Friedrich Weinmann has written a PowerShell module called the PSAzureMigrationAdvisor that can help you search your scripts for code that needs to be migrated and help you get started getting your code up to speed with the new cmdlets.

For those who are familiar with Fred's work, you know he makes some amazing tools, and this appears to be another fantastic tool for your arsenal. Fred will do a super deep dive into Migrating Azure Code, the AST and Extensible Code Design. Join us for a peek under the covers of this migration advisor and what it took for Fred to build the toolset.
