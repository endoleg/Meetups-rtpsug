### Summary

Crescendo is a recently released PowerShell module from the PowerShell team. It allows you to easily create PowerShell modules and cmdlets for native commands that don't play nice with PowerShell today. Programs like kubectl, ipconfig, docker, etc become PowerShell capable; giving you the full potential of PowerShell to streamline your workflows. Simple string output becomes object data in PowerShell, allowing you to use all the goodness you love about PowerShell.
Join Stephen Valdinger for a dive into how Crescendo works, and see how he used it to turn some of the cmd line tools he uses into PowerShell cmdlets.
